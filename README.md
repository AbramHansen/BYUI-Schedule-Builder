# BYUI Course Schedule Builder

Find optimized schedules for your semester!

## Online demo

The online demo is only partially working, due to AWS issues! However, at least the frontend can be found at [http://trevinjones.com/byui-schedule-builder-frontend](http://trevinjones.com/byui-schedule-builder-frontend).

## Local build

Clone this repo, install the requirements, and run main.py.

Clone [the frontend repo](https://github.com/trevin-j/byui-schedule-builder-frontend). cd into it, run `npm install` and then `npm run dev`.

Open the local link and enjoy.
